A Weather Dashboard

On this weeks challenge, we are tasked with creating a Weather Dashboard which populates a 5 day forecast.

Open Weather Map was used to access current weather records as well as moment.js for the dates.

A prompt will ask to know your location, if you allow, then your current locations 5 day weather forecast will populate.

The Weather Dashboard will provide information on the temp, humidity, wind speed as well as the uv index.

The use of local storage helps store your recent searches.
